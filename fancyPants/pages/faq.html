                <h1>Freqently Asked Question</h1>
                <h2><a href="#">What do we do?</a></h2>
                <div>
                    <p>We believe that the key to a great party is originality and we go above and beyond to deliver extraordinary events with a truly bespoke 
                        and personal service. Whether you intend to invite 20 or 2,000 guests, we aim to make the impossible possible, making each and every event we 
                        create highly unique and individual whilst keeping our pricing realistic and affordable. <span class = "brand_name">FancyPants Event Designs</span> specialise in organising private parties, 
                        weddings, award ceremonies, corporate events, Christmas parties and bar/bat Mitzvahs. Our team will help you transform a space into a wonderland, 
                        with incredible food, delicious drinks and fabulous entertainment. We love everything about our job and are honest and upfront when it comes to quoting for parties, 
                        as well as always doing our utmost to stick within your budget or finding alternate options when necessary.</p>
                </div>

                <h2><a href="#">Why us?</a></h2>
                <div>
                    <p>We pride ourselves on being a small company and take a personal approach to organising your event, always arranging our free consultations and schedule around yours. 
                        Professional party planning is a highly intensive full time job and we have spent a vast amount of time discovering trade secrets and 
                        getting to know trusted suppliers. We know all the right people and places and have the experience to know what works and what doesn’t in 
                        each individual situation. <span class = "brand_name">FancyPants Event Designs</span> believe each event is an experience and the best are filled with colour, sound, theatricality and an 
                        incredible energy from start to finish.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2><a href="#">Costing?</a></h2>
                <div>
                    <p>All our consultations are free and instead of offering standardised packages or standardised fees, each event is customised based on the client’s needs and 
                        the scope of the event. We will always offer the best service your budget can buy and will search around for the most competitive prices whilst remaining 
                        completely transparent about the pricing. We intend to help you save money, having built relationships with venues and suppliers, we get ‘freinds rates’ 
                        and ‘trade discounts’ that we will always pass on to you. We add an event management fee to the overall cost of the event but this is usually counteracted 
                        by the fact that we will pass on all our trade discounts to you and you are not taking risks in using suppliers who promise the earth and deliver disappointment.</p>
